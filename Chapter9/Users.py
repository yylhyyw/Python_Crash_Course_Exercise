# Make a class called User. Create two attributes called first_name
# and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are typically stored
# in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user() that prints a summary
# of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called greet_user() that prints
# a personalized greeting to the user.
# Create several instances representing different users, and call both methods
# for each user.
